This module implements HTTP methods for end user

I currently think that they should be synchronized since they should not do IO
Where as endpoint module is designed for IO

	For example, the client may send a giant file 1GB,
	the user will want to write this stream to disk in real time
	Also, buffering 1GB in memory is kind of stupid.
	
	But nonethelss, the current focus is on better organization of code instead of more API or performace.
